# Chladni-Patterns
Animated Chladni patterns in processing

Based on closed form solution for an approximation of a chladni pattern by Rian Hunter (https://thelig.ht/chladni/)

Currently only m and n are being changed but a, b, m, and n can be changed giving different patterns

An artistic liberty has been taking with the colouring of the pattern and the pattern will not look exactly like the 
graph of the closed form solution as finding the exact x and y point which is 0 is too computationally intensive so
there is an error value that can be changed
